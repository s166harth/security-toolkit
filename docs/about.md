# About

This is only a collection of tools for Nix/NixOS to perform penetration tests, security assessments,
CTF, and other tasks related to information security. The tool section for networking is also
quite extensive.

It's a combination of well-known tools with brand-new one. The approach of the set is based on the
actual need for different tools, be able to use the same tools in the same version on different
distributions (only possible if the distribution supports `nix`) and not to have everything what
others have.

It's all about the tools. 

How you are going to use it, is up to you. Use them on a regular system, in a shell or as virtual
machine. Take a look at the "Other projects" section for inspiration.
